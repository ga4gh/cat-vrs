# Contributing
As a product of the Genomic Knowledge Standards Workstream of GA4GH, the development of the projects and contributions of this repository are expected to hew relatively close to the standards utilized in [the VRS development process]((https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/stable/appendices/development_process.html)). The additional information presented here are guidelines for issues, branches, commits, and pull requests. Before adding documentation, please also review the [docs style guide](docs/source/appendices/style.rst).

## Discussions
[Discussions](https://github.com/ga4gh/cat-vrs/discussions) are for discussion, design decisions, bug
reports, and feature requests. When creating an issue, use sentence case
for the issue title and avoid the use of periods at the end of titles.

## Issues
[Issues](https://github.com/ga4gh/cat-vrs/issues) are for used to track additions, bugs fixes, or other issues that are intended to be implmented, often as the outcome of a [discussion](https://github.com/ga4gh/cat-vrs/discussions). When creating an issue, use sentence case for the issue title and avoid the use of periods at the end of titles.

## Branches
[Branches](https://github.com/ga4gh/cat-vrs/branches) are used for
versioning and feature additions. Version branches are to be created by
repo administrators only. Feature branches must be associated with an
open issue describing the desired feature, and named after the issue
as <issue number>-<short-description>. For example, the associated
branch for [issue 15](https://github.com/ga4gh/cat-vrs/tree/Issue-15) could
be `15-bug fix`.

## Pull Requests
[Pull Requests](https://github.com/ga4gh/cat-vrs/pulls) (PRs) for new 
features should target the `main` branch. For version 
patches, the PR should target the appropriate minor version branch.
PRs must be approved by at least one project maintainer before they may
be merged. PR titles must reflect the issue associated with the PR. For
example, the associated PR title for 
[issue 15](https://github.com/ga4gh/cat-vrs/tree/Issue-15) would be
`#15: fix Bug`.
