  EGFR L858R has long been recognized as a functionally significant mutation in cancer,
  and is one of the most prevalent single mutations in lung cancer. Best described in
  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the mutation seems to confer sensitivity to first
  and second generation TKI's like gefitinib and neratinib. NSCLC patients with this
  mutation treated with TKI's show increased overall and progression-free survival, as
  compared to chemotherapy alone. Third generation TKI's are currently in clinical trials
  that specifically focus on mutant forms of EGFR, a few of which have shown efficacy in
  treating patients that failed to respond to earlier generation TKI therapies.
