**Computational Definition**

A canonical allele is defined by an `Allele <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/2.0/terms_and_model.html#variation>`  that is representative of a collection of congruent Alleles, each of which depict the same nucleic acid  change on different underlying reference sequences. Congruent representations of an Allele often exist across different genome assemblies and associated cDNA transcript representations.

    **Information Model**
    
Some CanonicalAllele attributes are inherited from :ref:`CategoricalVariation`.

          - The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID. This 'id' is unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different system, or may refer to an 'id' for the shared concept in another system (e.g. a CURIE).
