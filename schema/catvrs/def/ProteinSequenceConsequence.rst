**Computational Definition**

A change that occurs in a protein sequence as a result of genomic changes. Due to the degenerate nature of the genetic code, there are often several genomic changes that can cause a protein sequence consequence. The protein sequence consequence, like a :ref:`CanonicalAllele`, is defined by an `Allele <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/2.0/terms_and_model.html#variation>` that is representative of a collection of congruent Protein Alleles that share the same altered codon(s).

    **Information Model**
    
Some ProteinSequenceConsequence attributes are inherited from :ref:`CategoricalVariation`.

          - The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID. This 'id' is unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different system, or may refer to an 'id' for the shared concept in another system (e.g. a CURIE).

          - The `VRS Allele <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/2.0/terms_and_model.html#allele>`_ object that is congruent with (projects to the same codons) as alleles on other protein reference  sequences.
