  ProteinSequenceConsequence:
    maturity: draft
    type: object
    inherits: CategoricalVariation
    description: >-
      A change that occurs in a protein sequence as a result of genomic changes. Due to the degenerate nature
      of the genetic code, there are often several genomic changes that can cause a protein sequence consequence.
      The protein sequence consequence, like a :ref:`CanonicalAllele`, is defined by an
      `Allele <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/2.0/terms_and_model.html#variation>` that is representative of a collection
      of congruent Protein Alleles that share the same altered codon(s).

          sequences.

  CanonicalAllele:
    maturity: draft
    inherits: CategoricalVariation
    description: >-
      A canonical allele is defined by an `Allele <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/2.0/terms_and_model.html#variation>` 
      that is representative of a collection of congruent Alleles, each of which depict the same nucleic acid 
      change on different underlying reference sequences. Congruent representations of an Allele often exist
      across different genome assemblies and associated cDNA transcript representations.

  CategoricalCnv:
    maturity: draft
    type: object
    inherits: CategoricalVariation
    description: >-
      A categorical variation domain is defined first by a sequence derived from a canonical `Location 
      <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/2.0/terms_and_model.html#Location>`_ , which is representative of 
      a collection of congruent Locations. The change or count of this sequence is also described, either
      by a numeric value (e.g. "3 or more copies") or categorical representation (e.g. "high-level gain"). 
      Categorical CNVs may optionally be defined by rules specifying the location match characteristics for 
      member CNVs.
    properties:
      type:
        type: string
        const: CategoricalCnv
        default: CategoricalCnv
        description: 'MUST be "CategoricalCnv"'
      location:

          object that represents a sequence derived from that location, and is congruent with locations 
          on alternate reference sequences.
      locationMatchCharacteristic:
        type: string

        description: >-
          The characteristics of a valid match between a contextual CNV location (the query) and the 
          Categorical CNV location (the domain), when both query and domain are represented on the same 
          reference sequence. An `exact` match requires the location of the query and domain to be identical. 
          A `subinterval` match requires the query to be a subinterval of the domain. A `superinterval` match
          requires the query to be a superinterval of the domain. A `partial` match requires at least 1 residue
          of overlap between the query and domain.

        type: string
        enum: [ "efo:0030069", "efo:0020073", "efo:0030068", "efo:0030067", "efo:0030064", "efo:0030070", "efo:0030071", "efo:0030072" ]

  DescribedVariation:
    maturity: draft
    type: object
    inherits: CategoricalVariation
    description: >-
      Some categorical variation concepts are supported by custom nomenclatures or text-descriptive
      representations for which a categorical variation model does not exist. DescribedVariation is
      a class that adds requirements and contextual semantics to the `label` and `description` fields
      to indicate how a categorical variation concept should be evaluated for matching variants.
