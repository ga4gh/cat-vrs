  ProteinSequenceConsequence:

    inherits: CategoricalVariation
    description: >-
      A change that occurs in a protein sequence as a result of genomic changes. Due to the degenerate nature
      of the genetic code, there are often several genomic changes that can cause a protein sequence consequence.
      The protein sequence consequence, like a :ref:`CanonicalAllele`, is defined by an
      `Allele <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/2.0/terms_and_model.html#variation>` that is representative of a collection
      of congruent Protein Alleles that share the same altered codon(s).

      that is representative of a collection of congruent Alleles, each of which depict the same nucleic acid 
      change on different underlying reference sequences. Congruent representations of an Allele often exist
      across different genome assemblies and associated cDNA transcript representations.

      <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/2.0/terms_and_model.html#Location>`_ , which is representative of 
      a collection of congruent Locations. The change or count of this sequence is also described, either
      by a numeric value (e.g. "3 or more copies") or categorical representation (e.g. "high-level gain"). 
      Categorical CNVs may optionally be defined by rules specifying the location match characteristics for 
      member CNVs.
