   "description": "A change that occurs in a protein sequence as a result of genomic changes. Due to the degenerate nature of the genetic code, there are often several genomic changes that can cause a protein sequence consequence. The protein sequence consequence, like a CanonicalAllele, is defined by an [Allele](https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/2.x/concepts/MolecularVariation/Allele.html#) that is representative of a collection of congruent Protein Alleles that share the same altered codon(s).",
