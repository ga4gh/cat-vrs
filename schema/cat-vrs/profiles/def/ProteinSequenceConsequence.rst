**Computational Definition**

A change that occurs in a protein sequence as a result of genomic changes. Due to the degenerate nature of the genetic code, there are often several genomic changes that can cause a protein sequence consequence. The protein sequence consequence, like a :ref:`CanonicalAllele`, is defined by an `Allele <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/2.x/concepts/MolecularVariation/Allele.html#>` that is representative of a collection of congruent Protein Alleles that share the same altered codon(s).
