Due to the degenerate nature of the genetic code, there are often several genomic changes that can cause a protein sequence consequence. The protein sequence consequence, like a CanonicalAllele, is defined by an `Allele <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/2.0/terms_and_model.html#variation>` that is representative of a collection of congruent Protein Alleles that share the same altered codon(s).",
