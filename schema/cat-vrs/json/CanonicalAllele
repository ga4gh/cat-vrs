Congruent representations of an Allele often exist across different genome assemblies and associated cDNA transcript representations.",

         "$comment": "Note that it is common for implementers to create their own internal logical ids - typically a serially or randomly generated value like a UUID that is assigned to the data object as it is created in a system. But an implementer may choose to re-use an existing, globally unique id from an external system or authority for this purpose (e.g. an HGNC id for a Gene object) - as long as it is unique within the implementing system, and can be used to reference the identified object in this context."
