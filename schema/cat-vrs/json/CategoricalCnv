The change or count of this sequence is also described, either by a numeric value (e.g. \"3 or more copies\") or categorical representation (e.g. \"high-level gain\").  Categorical CNVs may optionally be defined by rules specifying the location match characteristics for  member CNVs.",

But an implementer may choose to re-use an existing, globally unique id from an external system or authority for this purpose (e.g. an HGNC id for a Gene object) - as long as it is unique within the implementing system, and can be used to reference the identified object in this context."
